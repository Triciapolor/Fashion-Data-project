# Fashion-Data-project
This is a project that I have been working on to up skill myself on machine learning concepts. I have taken a focus on data relating to the fashion industry in combining my interests with coding. My initiial goal was to use time series analysis to predict the next piece of clothing that is likely to come up as a trend. However upon havibg issues with my pathname and trying to fix this i came across tensor flow and decided to use this instead as a means to use the readily availale Fashion MNIST-dataset
