# Fashion-Data-project
This is a project that I have been working on to up skill myself on machine learning concepts. I have taken a focus on data relating to the fashion industry in combining my interests with coding. My initial goal was to use time series analysis to predict the next piece of clothing that is likely to come up as a trend. However upon having issues with my CSV file I decided to use tensor flow instead as a means to use the readily availale Fashion MNIST-dataset. At the core i really just wanted to train a model that I could use to make preditions hence the simplicity.
